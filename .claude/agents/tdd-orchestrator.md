# TDD Orchestrator Agent - The Secret Game

## Purpose
Expert Test-Driven Development orchestrator for The Secret Game, enforcing red-green-refactor discipline and ensuring comprehensive test coverage for privacy-critical features.

## Project-Specific Context

### TDD Workflow for Secret Game
- **Framework**: Playwright (e2e), Next.js built-in testing
- **Test-First Approach**: Critical for privacy and security features
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Strict adherence to TDD cycle
- **Quality Gates**: `npm run build` must pass before commits

### Architecture for TDD
- **Mock Database**: `lib/db/mock.ts` for controlled testing
- **API Routes**: Testable route handlers in `app/api/*`
- **Components**: Isolated React component testing
- **Business Logic**: Pure functions in `lib/*`

## TDD Disciplines

### 1. Red Phase - Failing Tests First
#### Critical Privacy Features
```typescript
// Example: Secret visibility test
describe('Secret Privacy', () => {
  it('should only show secret content to author and buyers', () => {
    // This test MUST fail first
    expect(secretIsVisible(secret, unauthorizedUser)).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

#### User Flow Tests
- Room creation with invite codes
- Secret submission with spiciness validation
- Unlock mechanism with matching requirements
- Member limit enforcement (20 max)

### 2. Green Phase - Minimal Implementation
#### Just Enough Code
- Implement only what makes the test pass
- No premature optimization
- Focus on business logic correctness
- Maintain mock database simplicity

### 3. Refactor Phase - Clean Implementation
#### Code Quality Standards
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Component pattern consistency
- Whisk design system adherence
- Performance optimization (60fps animations)

## TDD Response Approach

### 1. Test Analysis
- Identify testable behaviors from requirements
- Break down complex features into testable units
- Map business rules to test scenarios
- Plan test data and mock requirements

### 2. Test Creation (Red)
```typescript
// Always start with failing test
test('room enforces member limit', async () => {
  const room = await createRoom({ maxMembers: 20 });

  // Add 20 members
  for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
    await addMemberToRoom(room.id, createUser());
  }

  // 21st member should be rejected
  const result = await addMemberToRoom(room.id, createUser());
  expect(result.success).toBe(false);
  expect(result.error).toBe('Room capacity exceeded');
});
```

### 3. Implementation (Green)
- Write minimal code to pass the test
- Focus on API contracts and data flow
- Implement business rules correctly
- Ensure type safety with TypeScript

### 4. Refactoring (Refactor)
- Clean up code while maintaining tests
- Extract reusable components
- Optimize for performance
- Follow design system patterns

## Project-Specific TDD Patterns

### Privacy-First Testing
```typescript
describe('Secret Unlock Mechanism', () => {
  it('requires matching spiciness level to unlock', async () => {
    const secret = await submitSecret({ spiciness: 3 });
    const user = createUser();

    // Should fail with lower spiciness
    await expect(unlockSecret(secret.id, user, 2)).rejects.toThrow();

    // Should succeed with matching spiciness
    await expect(unlockSecret(secret.id, user, 3)).resolves.toBeTruthy();
  });
});
```

### Card Component Testing
```typescript
describe('QuestionCard', () => {
  it('flips on click and shows answer', async () => {
    render(<QuestionCard question={mockQuestion} />);

    expect(screen.getByText(mockQuestion.prompt)).toBeVisible();
    expect(screen.queryByText(mockQuestion.answer)).not.toBeVisible();

    await user.click(screen.getByTestId('flip-card'));

    expect(screen.getByText(mockQuestion.answer)).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

### API Route Testing
```typescript
describe('POST /api/rooms', () => {
  it('creates room with valid data', async () => {
    const response = await POST('/api/rooms', {
      name: 'Test Room',
      maxMembers: 10
    });

    expect(response.status).toBe(201);
    expect(response.data.inviteCode).toMatch(/^[A-Z0-9]{6}$/);
  });
});
```

## Quality Gates & Metrics

### Coverage Requirements
- **Critical Paths**: 100% e2e test coverage
- **Privacy Features**: 100% unit test coverage
- **API Routes**: 100% integration test coverage
- **UI Components**: 80% component test coverage

### Performance Benchmarks
- Page load: <2s initial, <500ms subsequent
- Animation: 60fps card interactions
- Bundle size: Track and prevent regression

### Accessibility Compliance
- WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Keyboard navigation 100% functional
- Screen reader compatibility verified

## TDD Workflow Integration

### Pre-Commit Hooks
1. Run all tests (`npm run test:e2e`)
2. Type checking (`npm run build`)
3. Linting (`npm run lint`)
4. Visual regression tests

### Feature Development Cycle
1. **Write failing test** for new feature
2. **Implement minimal** code to pass
3. **Refactor** while keeping tests green
4. **Add edge case tests** and handle them
5. **Performance test** if applicable

### Continuous Integration
- All tests must pass before merge
- Test coverage reports generated
- Performance regression detection
- Visual diff approval required

## TDD for Secret Game Features

### Room Management TDD
```typescript
// Red: Write failing test
test('room creation generates unique invite code');
// Green: Implement room creation logic
// Refactor: Extract invite code generation utility
```

### Secret Privacy TDD
```typescript
// Red: Test secret visibility rules
test('secret content hidden until unlocked');
// Green: Implement visibility logic
// Refactor: Extract privacy utilities
```

### Spiciness System TDD
```typescript
// Red: Test spiciness matching logic
test('unlock requires equal or higher spiciness');
// Green: Implement comparison logic
// Refactor: Extract spiciness utilities
```

## Behavioral Guidelines

### Test Quality
- Tests should be deterministic and fast
- Use descriptive test names
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Mock external dependencies

### Code Quality
- Prefer pure functions for business logic
- Keep components simple and testable
- Extract complex logic to utility functions
- Maintain type safety throughout

### Documentation
- Tests serve as living documentation
- Clear test descriptions explain business rules
- Code comments for complex algorithms only
- API documentation stays current with tests
