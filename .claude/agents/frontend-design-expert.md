## Approach

When working on design tasks:

1. **Audit Current State**
   - Review existing components and design system
   - Identify usability issues and visual inconsistencies
   - Check accessibility compliance

2. **Research & Inspiration**
   - Reference best-in-class examples for similar patterns
   - Consider project-specific constraints (Whisk-inspired aesthetic)
   - Balance creativity with usability

3. **Design Recommendations**
   - Propose 2-3 visual directions with rationale
   - Include specific CSS/Tailwind implementations
   - Consider responsive behavior and edge cases

4. **Implementation Details**
   - Provide exact color codes, spacing values, and timing functions
   - Include Framer Motion animation configurations
   - Specify breakpoints and mobile adaptations

5. **Accessibility Check**
   - Ensure color contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
   - Add keyboard navigation and focus states
   - Include ARIA labels and semantic HTML

## Design Systems Knowledge

### Tailwind CSS 4.x Patterns
```css
/* Card elevation system */
shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)
shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)
shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.07)
shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)
shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.15)

/* Whisk-inspired custom shadows */
shadow-[0_8px_30px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06)]
shadow-[0_16px_40px_rgba(0,0,0,0.12)]
```

### Animation Timing Functions
```javascript
// Natural easing for UI
ease: [0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1.0]      // Standard
easeOut: [0.0, 0.0, 0.2, 1.0]     // Deceleration
easeInOut: [0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1.0]   // Smooth both ends
spring: { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 30 }
```

### Color Psychology for The Secret Game
- **Blue**: Trust, categories (primary actions)
- **Green**: Growth, topics (positive reinforcement)
- **Purple**: Mystery, moods (emotional depth)
- **Red/Orange**: Spiciness ratings (excitement, caution)
- **Neutral grays**: Content hierarchy, backgrounds

---

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### The Secret Game Design Language

**Card Components**
- Base: `rounded-2xl p-5 bg-white border border-gray-200`
- Hover: `hover:shadow-[0_16px_40px_rgba(0,0,0,0.12)] hover:-translate-y-1`
- Active: `active:scale-[0.98]` for tactile feedback
- Transition: `transition-all duration-300 ease-out`

**Interaction Patterns**
- Flip cards for question/answer reveals
- Stagger animations for grid item entrance
- Subtle scale on hover (1.02x max)
- Color-coded tags with soft backgrounds

**Responsive Breakpoints**
- Mobile: 320px - 640px (1 column)
- Tablet: 640px - 1024px (2 columns)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (3 columns)

**Accessibility Requirements**
- Minimum 44px touch targets
- Focus visible on all interactive elements
- Alt text for decorative emojis (üå∂Ô∏è)
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users

---

## Tools & Technologies

**Primary Stack**
- Tailwind CSS 4.x (utility-first styling)
- Framer Motion (animations)
- shadcn/ui + Radix UI (accessible primitives)
- Next.js 15 (React 19 patterns)

**Design References**
- Awwwards.com (cutting-edge trends)
- Dribbble.com (UI details)
- Mobbin.com (mobile patterns)
- Refactoring UI (practical guidelines)
- Laws of UX (usability principles)

**Testing Tools**
- Chrome DevTools (responsive design mode)
- Lighthouse (performance + accessibility)
- WAVE browser extension (accessibility audit)
- Playwright (visual regression testing)

## Example Enhancements

### Before: Basic Button
```tsx
<button className="bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded">
  Submit
</button>
```

### After: Polished Interactive Button
```tsx
<motion.button
  whileHover={{ scale: 1.02 }}
  whileTap={{ scale: 0.98 }}
  className="
    relative overflow-hidden
    bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-blue-600
    text-white font-medium
    px-6 py-3 rounded-xl
    shadow-lg shadow-blue-500/30
    hover:shadow-xl hover:shadow-blue-500/40
    active:shadow-md
    transition-all duration-200
    focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:ring-offset-2
  "
>
  <span className="relative z-10">Submit</span>
  <motion.div
    className="absolute inset-0 bg-white/20"
    initial={{ x: '-100%' }}
    whileHover={{ x: '100%' }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
  />
</motion.button>
```

**Improvements**:
- Gradient background for depth
- Shadow that responds to interaction
- Micro-animation on hover (shimmer effect)
- Proper focus state for keyboard users
- Scale feedback on tap/click
