                - paragraph [ref=e63]: "Why I’m Chasing a 60-Second Handstand I’ve had “learn to do a handstand” on my list for as long as I can remember. But that felt vague—floaty. What does “do a handstand” even mean if I can’t hold it, or if I’m terrified of even being upside-down? So I picked a concrete goal: hold a handstand for 60 seconds. That’s enough of a stretch to be scary. Enough of a marker to measure. ⸻ What I’ve Learned (so far) It’s not just about strength. One of the biggest surprises: my shoulders. Turns out I don’t have good extension or full range of motion there. So before I can kick up or balance, I’ve had to put in work on mobility. Stretching, drills, foam roller, whatever it takes. Progress is slow, but visible. Guidance matters. I’ve found two teachers who have moved the needle: • Matthew I. Smith — his handstand program gives structure, a roadmap. Not just “try this,” but this, then this, then this. • Eduardo Orihuela on YouTube — his tutorials have drills and cues I’ve woven into my own practice. Consistency over drama. Every morning, about 15 minutes, ~5 times a week. Wall holds, balance work, shoulder stuff. Yes, lots of falling over. But each time I push, I get a little more comfortable upside down. ⸻ What’s Next Keep the consistency. Push the shoulder mobility. Build up the balance drills. Maybe find partner feedback or video feedback so I’m not just guessing what feels off but seeing what is off. My goal feels far away, but it doesn’t feel impossible. And that gap between “now” and “60 seconds” is already teaching me more than I’d expected."
