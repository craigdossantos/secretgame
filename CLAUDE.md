# CLAUDE.md - The Secret Game

> AI assistant playbook for **The Secret Game**: a card-based secret sharing app for small friend groups. Ship maintainable features quickly with tests and accessibility baked in. Prefer small, reversible changes.

---

## 1) Purpose & Operating Rules

**Mission Statement**

The Secret Game enables small friend groups (‚â§20) to exchange secrets via invite URLs. Users unlock secrets by submitting secrets of matching "spiciness" levels. UI inspired by Google Labs Whisk with tactile, card-based design.

**Non-negotiables**

* Prefer **small, reversible changes** with proper testing
* Ask before destructive actions (schema changes, secrets, deletes)
* Follow commands and conventions defined here
* Maintain Whisk-inspired card design principles
* Keep secrets private (only author + "buyers" see content)

**Current Status & Context**

* ‚úÖ **MVP Complete**: Question prompts, unified tagging, room system
* ‚úÖ **Build Ready**: Successfully deployed to Vercel
* üîÑ **Architecture**: Mock database (simplified from Drizzle/Supabase)
* üìã **Roadmap**: See PROJECT_PLAN.md for V1+ features

---

## 2) Architecture Snapshot

* **Framework:** Next.js 15.5.3 (App Router) + Turbopack for development
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4.x + shadcn/ui (Radix UI primitives)
* **State:** React state + mock database; no global state management
* **Data:** Mock implementation in `lib/db/mock.ts` (prepared for Drizzle + Postgres)
* **Auth:** Cookie-based temporary users (prepared for NextAuth.js)
* **API:** Route handlers under `app/api/*`; mock database operations
* **Build:** TypeScript strict; ESLint configured
* **Testing:** Playwright for e2e; unit testing with built-in Next.js tools
* **Animations:** Framer Motion for card interactions and micro-animations

**Key Design Constraints**

* Card-first UI with Whisk-inspired styling (`rounded-2xl`, subtle shadows)
* Gamified interactions (üå∂Ô∏è spiciness ratings, unlock mechanism)
* Privacy-first (secrets gated behind "unlocking" system)
* Mobile-responsive with tactile hover effects

---

## 3) Commands Claude Should Use

> Claude: prefer these exact commands; do not invent alternatives unless asked.

**Install & bootstrap**
* `npm install` ‚Äî install dependencies
* `npm run dev` ‚Äî dev server (with Turbopack)
* `npm run build && npm start` ‚Äî production build & run

**Quality gates**
* `npm run build` ‚Äî TypeScript strict + production build
* `npm run lint` ‚Äî ESLint (warnings become errors on Vercel)
* `npm run test:e2e` ‚Äî Playwright e2e tests
* `npm run test:e2e:ui` ‚Äî Playwright with UI
* `npm run test:e2e:debug` ‚Äî Playwright debug mode

**Project helpers**
* `node screenshot.js` ‚Äî take full-page screenshot for debugging
* `git add . && git commit -m "..."` ‚Äî commit with AI attribution format

**Development Notes**
* Server runs on http://localhost:3000 (or next available port)
* Turbopack enables fast refresh and hot reload
* Build must pass before deployment to Vercel

---

## 4) File/Folder Conventions

* `app/` ‚Äî Next.js App Router; uses pages not route groups
* `app/page.tsx` ‚Äî homepage with question prompts grid
* `app/create/page.tsx` ‚Äî room creation flow
* `app/rooms/[id]/page.tsx` ‚Äî room view with secrets
* `app/admin/page.tsx` ‚Äî question management interface
* `app/api/*` ‚Äî route handlers; validate with TypeScript interfaces
* `components/ui/*` ‚Äî shadcn/ui primitives (Button, Card, etc.)
* `components/*` ‚Äî feature components; colocate related logic
* `lib/*` ‚Äî pure helpers and business logic
* `lib/db/mock.ts` ‚Äî mock database implementation
* `lib/questions.ts` ‚Äî question parsing and tag management
* `data/questions.md` ‚Äî markdown source for question content

**Naming**

* Components: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `QuestionCard`)
* Files: `kebab-case.tsx` (e.g., `question-card.tsx`)
* API routes: RESTful (`/api/rooms`, `/api/rooms/[id]`)
* Interfaces: match component names (`QuestionCardProps`)

**Component Structure**
```tsx
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props interface first
}

export function Component({ prop }: ComponentProps) {
  // 1. Hooks
  const [state, setState] = useState();

  // 2. Event handlers
  const handleEvent = () => {};

  // 3. Render
  return <div />;
}
```

## 5) UI & Accessibility Expectations

**Design System (Whisk-inspired)**
* Cards: `rounded-2xl p-5 shadow-[0_8px_30px_rgba(0,0,0,0.06)] bg-white border border-gray-200`
* Hover: `hover:shadow-[0_16px_40px_rgba(0,0,0,0.12)]` with subtle `y: -4` transform
* Colors: Blue for categories, green for topics, purple for moods
* Typography: Clean, readable with proper contrast ratios

**Interaction Patterns**
* Flip cards for question ‚Üí answer flow
* Chili pepper ratings (üå∂Ô∏è x1-5) for "spiciness"
* Smooth Framer Motion animations on hover/press
* Grid layouts: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` for cards

**Accessibility Requirements**
* All interactive elements must be focusable and keyboard-accessible
* Include `aria-*` labels for icon-only controls (chili peppers, buttons)
* Maintain proper tab order throughout forms and grids
* Provide loading states, empty states, and error boundaries

**Definition of Done (UI)**
* Pixel-approximate to Whisk design principles (cards, shadows, spacing)
* All states implemented (hover, focus, loading, error)
* No console errors; proper semantic HTML structure

## 6) API & Data Contracts

**Current Implementation: Mock Database**
* Located in `lib/db/mock.ts` - simulates persistence for development
* Cookie-based temporary user system (no real auth yet)
* In-memory data store with CRUD operations

**Data Models**
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string; email: string; name: string; avatarUrl?: string; createdAt: Date;
}
interface Room {
  id: string; name: string; ownerId: string; inviteCode: string;
  maxMembers: number; questionIds?: string[]; createdAt: Date;
}
interface Secret {
  id: string; roomId: string; authorId: string; body: string;
  selfRating: number; importance: number; avgRating?: number;
  buyersCount: number; createdAt: Date;
}
```

**API Patterns**
* Use helpers from `lib/api/helpers.ts`: `successResponse()`, `errorResponse()`
* Validate inputs: word count ‚â§100, ratings 1-5, required fields
* Return typed responses with proper HTTP status codes
* Handle Next.js 15 async params: `const id = (await params).id`

**Business Rules**
* Unlock mechanism: submit secret with same/higher spiciness level
* Room capacity: 20 members maximum
* Secret visibility: only author + "buyers" see full content
* Questions: 12 curated from markdown, room-specific selection

---

## 7) Security & Permissions

**Current Security Model**
* Cookie-based temporary users (no passwords/tokens yet)
* Room access via invite codes (unique, not guessable)
* Secret visibility gated by "unlock" mechanism
* No PII logging; mask user data in development

**Claude Guidelines**
* Never read or write `.env*` files without explicit instruction
* Do not run scripts outside this repository
* Avoid `sudo` or system-level operations
* When refactoring, work in feature branches for large changes
* Ask before touching authentication or secret-related logic

---

## 8) Testing Policy

**Current Testing Setup**
* E2E tests with Playwright for critical user flows
* Screenshot testing for UI debugging (`node screenshot.js`)
* Build testing ensures TypeScript/ESLint compliance

**Testing Guidelines**
* Test core flows: room creation, question answering, secret unlocking
* Add tests when fixing bugs (write failing test first, then fix)
* Use Playwright UI for interactive debugging: `npm run test:e2e:ui`
* Screenshot before/after for UI changes

**Definition of Done**
* `npm run build` passes (TypeScript + production build)
* Core e2e flows work in latest test run
* No console errors in development mode

---

## 9) Review & Definition of Done

A change is **done** when:

* **Builds cleanly**: `npm run build` passes without errors
* **Follows conventions**: matches existing patterns in codebase
* **Maintains design**: preserves Whisk-inspired card aesthetics
* **Works end-to-end**: core user flows function properly
* **No regressions**: existing features continue working

**PR Checklist**
* [ ] Problem statement & approach explained
* [ ] Changes are small and focused (prefer <400 lines)
* [ ] Screenshots for UI changes
* [ ] Build passes locally
* [ ] Follows component/naming conventions
* [ ] No console errors in development

## 10) How to Collaborate with Claude (Workflow)

**Standard Loop** (follow unless told otherwise):

1. **Explore**: Read relevant files, understand current implementation
2. **Plan**: Propose focused changes (bullets), ask to proceed
3. **Implement**: Make small, reversible changes; show diffs
4. **Verify**: Run `npm run build`, check for errors, test manually
5. **Refine**: Fix issues iteratively
6. **Commit**: Use conventional format with AI attribution

**Project-Specific Patterns**

* **Bug fix**: Identify issue ‚Üí minimal fix ‚Üí test with `node screenshot.js`
* **New feature**: Check existing patterns ‚Üí follow card-based design ‚Üí add to appropriate section
* **UI change**: Maintain Whisk aesthetic ‚Üí test responsive behavior ‚Üí screenshot before/after

**When to Ask**
* Before changing core business logic (unlock mechanism, spiciness ratings)
* Before architectural changes (switching from mock database)
* When encountering deployment-related configuration
* If conventions conflict or are unclear

---

## 11) Known Issues & Project Context

**Current Architecture Decisions**
* **Mock Database**: Simplified from Drizzle+Supabase for development speed
* **Temporary Users**: Cookie-based, no real authentication yet
* **Asset Paths**: Configured for separate deployment (not proxy)

**Known Technical Debt**
* Next.js 15 compatibility: async params pattern (`const id = (await params).id`)
* TypeScript strictness: escape quotes in JSX (`&apos;`, `&quot;`)
* Build process: ESLint warnings become errors on Vercel

**Future Migration Path**
* Planned: Switch back to Drizzle + Supabase for persistence
* Planned: Implement NextAuth.js for proper authentication
* Planned: Add real-time polling (15s intervals)
* See `PROJECT_PLAN.md` for complete V1+ roadmap
