# Secret Game Development Session Summary

## 1. Primary Request and Intent

The user had several explicit requests throughout the session:

1. **MCP Server Configuration**: "configure the playwright mcp server on this project"
2. **Feature Implementation Brain Dump**:
   - "On the home page, I only want to show three questions, and then we'll put a button to refresh"
   - "When I create a room, you have to basically choose three questions to start the room with"
   - "The creative room should have a design similar to the home page"
   - "In addition to being able to choose some of the preformed questions, we also want to give them the ability to create a question"
3. **Git Workflow**: "do a git commit and then use a sub agent in case we need to roll back"
4. **Bug Fix**: "The questions aren't showing up in the room once I create it"
5. **Testing Request**: "Use playwright to go through the flow. I'm getting a room not found error"
6. **Final Request**: "Create a planning folder and then in it, put an MD file that summarizes this conversation. Don't do any more code fixing"

## 2. Key Technical Concepts

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Server configuration for Playwright integration
- **Next.js 15 with Turbopack**: App router, API routes, cookie handling
- **Playwright**: E2E testing framework with headed browser tests
- **React Components**: Question cards, selectors, modals with Whisk-inspired design
- **TypeScript**: Interfaces for QuestionPrompt, Room, CustomQuestion
- **Singleton Pattern**: Global database instance persistence in development
- **Cookie Authentication**: userId cookies for session management
- **Git Feature Branches**: Proper version control workflow

## 3. Files and Code Sections

### Configuration Files
- **playwright.config.ts**
  - Fixed port configuration from 3002 to 3000
  - Essential for Playwright tests to hit correct dev server
  ```typescript
  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run dev',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000',
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  }
  ```

### Core Feature Files
- **src/app/page.tsx**
  - Updated to show only 3 questions instead of 12
  - Added refresh button functionality
  - Implemented getRandomQuestions() for diverse selection
  ```typescript
  const [displayedQuestions, setDisplayedQuestions] = useState<QuestionPrompt[]>([]);
  const refreshQuestions = () => {
    setDisplayedQuestions(getRandomQuestions(allQuestions, 3, answeredQuestionIds));
  };
  ```

- **src/app/create/page.tsx**
  - Transformed into multi-step flow: basic info → questions → success
  - Added QuestionSelector integration
  - Handles both regular and custom questions
  ```typescript
  const [step, setStep] = useState<'basic' | 'questions' | 'success'>('basic');
  const [selectedQuestionIds, setSelectedQuestionIds] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [customQuestions, setCustomQuestions] = useState<QuestionPrompt[]>([]);
  ```

- **src/lib/questions.ts**
  - Added getRandomQuestions() function for homepage
  ```typescript
  export function getRandomQuestions(questions: QuestionPrompt[], count: number = 3, excludeIds: string[] = []): QuestionPrompt[]
  ```

### New Components (Created by Subagent)
- **src/components/question-selector.tsx**: Multi-select question grid with 3-question limit
- **src/components/custom-question-modal.tsx**: Form for creating custom questions
- **src/app/demo-question-selector/page.tsx**: Demo page for testing

### API Updates
- **src/app/api/rooms/route.ts**
  - Updated to accept questionIds and customQuestions
  - Fixed cookie handling for Next.js 15
  ```typescript
  const { name = 'Secret Room', userName, questionIds = [], customQuestions = [] } = body;
  if (questionIds.length + customQuestions.length !== 3) {
    return errorResponse('Exactly 3 questions must be selected');
  }
  ```

- **src/app/api/rooms/[id]/route.ts**
  - Added questionIds and customQuestions to response
  ```typescript
  return successResponse({
    room: {
      id: room.id,
      name: room.name,
      memberCount,
      inviteCode: room.inviteCode,
      ownerId: room.ownerId,
      questionIds: room.questionIds || [],
      customQuestions: room.customQuestions || [],
      isMember: true,
    },
  });
  ```

- **src/app/api/questions/route.ts** (New)
  - Created endpoint for fetching curated questions

### Room Display Fix
- **src/app/rooms/[id]/page.tsx**
  - Fixed cookie name from 'tempUserId' to 'userId'
  - Added support for custom questions
  ```typescript
  const userId = document.cookie
    .split('; ')
    .find(row => row.startsWith('userId='))
    ?.split('=')[1];
  ```

### Database Fix
- **src/lib/db/mock.ts**
  - Implemented singleton pattern to persist data across API calls
  ```typescript
  declare global {
    var __mockDb: MockDatabase | undefined;
  }
  export const mockDb = globalThis.__mockDb ?? new MockDatabase();
  globalThis.__mockDb = mockDb;
  ```

### Testing
- **tests/room-flow.spec.ts** (New)
  - Comprehensive E2E test for room creation flow

## 4. Errors and Fixes

### Next.js 15 Cookie Issue
- **Error**: Room creation failing due to cookies not being set
- **Fix**: Rewrote cookie handling to use NextResponse.cookies.set() instead of cookies().set()
- **User Feedback**: "what was wrong and what was fixed?"

### Room Questions Not Displaying
- **Error**: "The questions aren't showing up in the room once I create it"
- **Fix**:
  1. Updated API to return questionIds and customQuestions
  2. Fixed cookie name mismatch (tempUserId → userId)
  3. Added custom question processing in room page

### Playwright Port Mismatch
- **Error**: Tests hitting wrong page ("Hi, I'm Craig" instead of "The Secret Game")
- **Fix**: Updated playwright.config.ts from port 3002 to 3000

### Room Not Found Error
- **Error**: "Use playwright to go through the flow. I'm getting a room not found error"
- **Fix**: Implemented singleton pattern for mock database to persist data between API calls
- **Root Cause**: Each API call was getting a fresh database instance in Next.js 15 with Turbopack

### TypeScript Compilation Errors
- **Error**: ESLint errors with 'any' types and unescaped quotes
- **Fix**: Added proper TypeScript interfaces and escaped apostrophes

## 5. Problem Solving

**Solved Problems:**
1. ✅ Homepage refresh functionality showing only 3 questions
2. ✅ Multi-step room creation with question selection
3. ✅ Custom question creation capability
4. ✅ Seamless design between pages using Whisk-inspired cards
5. ✅ Next.js 15 cookie compatibility issues
6. ✅ Mock database persistence across API calls

**Ongoing Troubleshooting:**
- Room API returning 404 errors for newly created rooms (was being investigated when user requested to stop)

## 6. All User Messages

1. "configure the playwright mcp server on this project"
2. "I'm going to brain dump a whole bunch of ideas, and I want you to create a plan for how we're going to execute on them..."
3. "add this to the project_plan.md file and proceed once you've updated that file accordingly and done a git checkout for these features"
4. "do a git commit and then use a sub agent in case we need to roll back"
5. "The questions aren't showing up in the room once I create it"
6. "what was wrong and what was fixed?"
7. "what dev servers are running? Kill whatever's running, and then give me a local version of the app to test"
8. "okay, try to create a room - on production it doesn't work. run a subagent to debug it and come back with what hte fix should be, then fix"
9. "Use playwright to go through the flow. I'm getting a room not found error"
10. "Create a planning folder and then in it, put an MD file that summarizes this conversation. Don't do any more code fixing"

## 7. Pending Tasks

Based on PROJECT_PLAN.md updates:
- Further testing of complete room creation flow with questions
- Deploy to production and verify fixes work there
- Implement secrets/answer submission from questions
- Add room member functionality

## 8. Current Work

**Immediate work before summary request:**
I was debugging why rooms created via API were not being found when queried. I had just:
1. Identified the singleton database issue
2. Implemented the fix using globalThis pattern
3. Added debug logging to track room creation and retrieval
4. Was testing the fix by creating a room and querying it

The last code change was updating `src/lib/db/mock.ts` to implement singleton pattern:
```typescript
declare global {
  var __mockDb: MockDatabase | undefined;
}
export const mockDb = globalThis.__mockDb ?? new MockDatabase();
globalThis.__mockDb = mockDb;
```

## 9. Git Status
