### 🔥 Understanding Spiciness Levels

When you answer a question, you rate how "spicy" (private) your answer is:

- **🌶️ Level 1:** Everyone knows this about me
- **🌶️🌶️ Level 2:** I'd share this casually
- **🌶️🌶️🌶️ Level 3:** Only close friends know
- **🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️ Level 4:** Very private, rarely shared
- **🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️🌶️ Level 5:** I've never told anyone this

**The Rule:** To unlock someone's Level 4 secret, you must share your own Level 4+ secret.

**Why?** This creates a fair exchange of vulnerability. The more you share, the more you learn.

4. Once you submit your secret, the locked one reveals!

- This ensures everyone contributes to unlock

### 🎭 Anonymous Mode

**When to Use It:**
- Answering very personal questions
- Topics you're not ready to own publicly

**How It Works:**

- Your answer shows as "Anonymous" with a **?** avatar
- Group can see the answer, but not who wrote it

**Note:** Room creators can still see your answer in the database (for moderation).
