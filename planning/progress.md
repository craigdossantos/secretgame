# The Secret Game ‚Äî Project Progress & Context

**Last Updated**: January 2025
**Status**: MVP Development - Room Creation & Question System Complete

---

## üéØ Project Overview

The Secret Game is a card-based secret sharing web app for small friend groups (‚â§20 people). Users join rooms via invite URLs, answer spicy questions, and unlock others' secrets by sharing their own. The UI follows Google Labs Whisk design principles with tactile, card-based interactions.

**Core Concept**: To unlock ("buy") someone's secret, you must submit your own secret with matching "spiciness" level (üå∂Ô∏è rating 1-5).

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.5.3 with App Router + Turbopack
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.x + shadcn/ui components
- **State**: React state + mock database (no global state management)
- **Database**: Mock in-memory implementation (`lib/db/mock.ts`)
- **Auth**: Cookie-based temporary users (no OAuth yet)
- **API**: Next.js route handlers with TypeScript validation
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for card interactions

### Architectural Decisions
1. **Simplified from Drizzle/Supabase** to mock database for faster MVP development
2. **Temporary user system** using cookies instead of full auth
3. **Mock database persists** across hot reloads using global singleton
4. **No real-time updates** - planning 15s polling for V1
5. **Build successfully deploys** to Vercel

## üîÑ Current State

### What's Working
- Full room creation flow with question selection
- Custom question creation with tags
- Mock database persistence across hot reloads
- Homepage with refreshable questions
- Admin interface for managing questions
- Whisk-inspired card UI with hover effects
- Build passes TypeScript strict mode
- Successfully deployed to Vercel

### Development Environment
- Multiple dev servers running (background processes)
- Turbopack for fast refresh
- Hot reload working properly
- Mock data persists during development

### Known Issues & Technical Debt
1. **Next.js 15 Async Params** - Using `(await params).id` pattern
2. **Multiple Dev Servers** - Several npm run dev processes in background
3. **No Real Auth** - Using cookies for temporary users
4. **No Secret Features Yet** - Room shows questions but no secret submission/unlock
5. **Mock Database Only** - Need to migrate back to Supabase for production
6. **No Polling** - Static data, no real-time updates

## üìä Data Models

```typescript
// Current Mock Database Schema
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  name: string;
  avatarUrl?: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

interface Room {
  id: string;
  name?: string;
  ownerId: string;
  inviteCode: string;
  maxMembers: number;
  questionIds?: string[];
  customQuestions?: CustomQuestion[];
  createdAt: Date;
}

interface Secret {
  id: string;
  roomId: string;
  authorId: string;
  body: string;
  selfRating: number;      // 1-5 spiciness
  importance: number;      // 1-5 keep-it-private
  avgRating?: number;
  buyersCount: number;
  createdAt: Date;
  isHidden: boolean;
}
```

- Supabase integration with RLS policies
- Real-time updates (15s polling initially)
- Categories & templates
- Basic moderation (report/hide)
- Owner tools
- Analytics & error logging
- Profile drawer
- Optional titles for secrets
- Filters and improved feed sort

- **Gray**: Formats

---

## üîê Security & Privacy

- Secrets only visible to author + "buyers"
- Room access via unique invite codes
- No PII logging in development
- Cookie-based temp users (no passwords)
- 20 member cap per room enforced

---

## üìù Notes for New Agents

1. **Always work on feature branches** - never commit directly to main
2. **Follow Whisk design principles** - cards, shadows, tactile feel
3. **Use mock database** - `lib/db/mock.ts` for all data operations
4. **Build must pass** - Run `npm run build` before committing
5. **Check CLAUDE.md** - Comprehensive guide for AI assistants
6. **Multiple dev servers running** - Check background processes if needed

---

## üêõ Debugging Tips

- Use `node screenshot.js` for visual debugging
- Check cookies for userId: `document.cookie`
- Mock DB persists via global: `globalThis.__mockDb`
- API responses use helpers: `successResponse()`, `errorResponse()`
- Next.js 15 async params: `const id = (await params).id`

**Ready for Next Phase**: The foundation is solid. Room creation and question system are complete. Next step is implementing the core secret sharing and unlock mechanism to make the game playable.
